## Duckshoot
This was the first assignment for my *C Programming* module during my first year!!

That should at least tell you not to expect too much. I did get a good enough mark for it so it seems I did something right at least.

This is a LED game. The board it's designed for has 10 LED lights which start alternately lit, they cycle left-to-right, or visa-versa. If the fire button is pressed when the right most light is on then it will switch off. If it is off, it'll turn on. To win you must simply turn all of the lights off. If not you lose.

### System
This was built to run on a *terasic DE0* development board with an *Altera Cyclone III* chip. I know they are a little old, but that is the way of universities! With this in mind the development suite from Altera *Quartus II* was used in conjunction with the *Eclipse* editor with their *NIOS 2* package.

>Just a side note... I have had a nightmare trying to get the setup correct on my own laptop (this is with the help of the teaching staff and tech guys at uni also) but there is documentation out there if you can find it. I did have it going for a bit, but it disappeared when I rebooted the system - so I threw out my teddies and gave up!!

### A little demo
OK, so this isn't sorted out YET, but I will get a video of the code in action and up on YouTube as soon as I can.
