## MARCO BOT

This is an attempt at creating two programs that will control a **MARCO_BOT** with the aim of making it operate as  a *line-follower* and a *room-escapeist*.

The MARCO bots are built at the university so information about the specifics of these will be unavailable (unless you happen to be a student at *UWE*).

###  A little demo
OK, so this isn't sorted out YET, but I will get a video of the code in action and up on YouTube as soon as I can.
