## Assignments

As I am studying for my *BSc (Hons) **Computer Systems Integration*** at The University of the West of England *(UWE)* I am required to complete assignments for marking.

I obviously use Github for source control, even if the uni use GitLab, and throughout development those repositories are kept private. Once the deadline has passed and I have received my marks for the project I shall move them into here.

#### Duckshoot
This was my first assignment for my *C Programming* module in yr 1. It is written for use on the **DE0** development board with a **Cyclone III** FPGA from Altera.

#### MARCO BOT
This was also for my  *C Programming* module in yr 1. It is for a purpose built bot produced by the university. This code makes the bot into a *line-follower* and *room-escaper*.
